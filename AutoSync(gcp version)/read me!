- run_fetch_zhHant.bat: Executes the download step
- run_convert_zhHant.bat: Executes the conversion step

- run_convert_zhHant_local_and_gcs.bat: Executes the conversion step and upload to your gcp bucket

## Usage
1. Double-click `run_fetch_zhHant.bat`. After completion, go to `data\xml\zh-Hant\` to check if the XML is present.
2. (local)Double-click `run_convert_zhHant.bat` again. After completion, check `data\md\zh-Hant\` to see if the .md file exists.
3. Both .bat files will clear the old files in the output folder.
4. (gcp)Re-write(*yourbucket*) and Double-click `run_convert_zhHant_local_and_gcs.bat`, check your bucket.

> Tip: The .bat file uses `%~dp0` to automatically retrieve the current folder path, so you can place the entire package in G:\HKeL\, D:\HKeL\, or the desktop.


Enjoy :)
