## Directories
- scripts\
- fetch_hkel.py: Downloads, verifies, and clears old files
- xml_to_md.py: Converts XML to Markdown and clears old files
- run_fetch_zhHant.bat: Executes the download step
- run_convert_zhHant.bat: Executes the conversion step
- data\xml\zh-Hant\: Downloaded XML files will be stored here
- data\md\zh-Hant\: Converted Markdown files will be stored here
- logs\: Log output

## Usage
1. Double-click `run_fetch_zhHant.bat`. After completion, go to `data\xml\zh-Hant\` to check if the XML is present.
2. Double-click `run_convert_zhHant.bat` again. After completion, check `data\md\zh-Hant\` to see if the .md file exists.
3. Both .bat files will clear the old files in the output folder.

> Tip: The .bat file uses `%~dp0` to automatically retrieve the current folder path, so you can place the entire package in G:\HKeL\, D:\HKeL\, or the desktop.

Enjoy :)
